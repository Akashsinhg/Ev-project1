# Ev-project1
Your Trusted EV Charging Station

This project is a web-based platform designed to support the growing electric vehicle (EV) community by providing a user-friendly interface to locate, book, and manage EV charging stations. It serves as a digital hub where users can find real-time charging availability, pricing, and support, while station owners can monitor and manage their infrastructure.
